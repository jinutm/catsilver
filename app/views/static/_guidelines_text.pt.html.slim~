p SilverAlms being an exclusive philanthropic platform, allows users to create fund requests for personal needs or for a common cause. But we strictly allow only the requests that fit into one of our categories. We help you to reach your requests before the global community and receive help instantly. Before you start a campaign on silverAlms or before you donate hard earned money to needy ones, we request you to learn the process of doing so.
