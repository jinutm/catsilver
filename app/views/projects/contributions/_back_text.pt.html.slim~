h2 I want to support now.
h3 How I support this project?
p First, select the desired value and reward. Then just click 'Review and make payment' which will redirect you to the next page to complete your payment.
h3 When payment is effected?
p Once Paypal confirm the transaction (card and bank transfer confirmation is on the same day, slips lead to 4 business days to be confirmed). Then, if the project does not reach #{@project.display_goal} in #{@project.display_expires_at}, you will get your money back in the form of credits from #{Configuration[:company_name]}.
h3 Did I get my money back if the project does not come out?
p Yes! You get back 100% of what it paid in the form of credits to support other projects in #{Configuration[:company_name]}.
h3 If I do not want to use the credits in #{Configuration[:company_name]}?
p No problem. Just enter the tab #{link_to t('credits.title'), user_path(current_user, anchor: :credits), :target => :_blank}, within 60 days after their support and request a chargeback. If you paid by credit card, the chargeback will be made on your next bill. Then we transfer the value of our account to yours and from there you transfer to your bank account.
h3 If the project is funded, how do I get my reward?
p When your reward is ready, #{link_to @project.user.display_name, user_path(@project.user)} will contact you to arrange delivery.
